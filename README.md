Growing bugs gotta eat.

### Purpose

* This is a simple snake game written for the javascript BBC micro model B emulator, [jsbeeb](https://bbc.godbolt.org/). I tried to convince my kids that it was a completely original caterpillar game and nothing to do with snakes, but they weren't having any of it.

* It was written as an entry for the [**2019 BASIC 10 liner contest**](http://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/kopie-von-basic-10liners-2019) in category **PUR-80**. The rules state that none of the lines of code should exceed 80 characters.

* In a turn of events that I find quite remarkable, the source code and a screenshot were published in a [2019 article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17445760.2019.1597085) by computer archaeologist Stefan HÃ¶ltgen.

### Features

* Fast, playable action!  
* Bleeps! Flashing lights! High score!  
* _Special bonus screen memory glitches!_

I don't know what causes the on-screen garbage: it might be something to do with how the emulator is implemented. You can get rid of it by typing `*TV254` before running the game: this command shifts the screen down a couple of lines.

### How to play

Download CAT80.zip from the [github repo](https://github.com/t0mpr1c3/catrpilr/raw/master/CAT80.zip) and extract the virtual disk `CAT80.ssd`. Upload the file into *jsbeeb*, or an offline emulator such as [BeebEm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeebEm), and type `CHAIN "CAT80"`. 

(Note that *jsbeeb* has a nonstandard keyboard mapping: on my US keyboard I got the double quote by typing `SHIFT-2`.)

Alternatively, copy/paste the BASIC code into the console of *BeebEm* and type `RUN`.

#### Controls

  *S* up  
  *X* down  
  *<* left  
  *>* right  
  
#### Tips

* Move around the caterpillar box eating the tasty red food that helps you grow.  
* Try not to bite your own tail or crash into the side of the box. That's like, ouch.  
* Look out for the power pills! For 10 seconds you will move extra quick, and score more points for all the food you eat.

### Code summary

There are lots of abbreviations and little tricks to cram in more functionality, which make the code practically unreadable. Here is a little guide if you have an urge to make sense of it all:

*Line 0.*
*	Initialize screen and variables
*	Run only once

*Line 1.*
*	Show high score at end of previous game
*	Start new game

*Line 2.*
*	Lose life, make death sound
* Update number of lives in status bar
*	Set up variables for next round

*Line 3.*
* Pause before next round
*	Draw game box

*Line 4.*
*	Update score
*	Make happy sound

*Line 5.*
* Randomly select location of next target
* Print score in status bar

*Line 6.*
*	Get keyboard input
* 'S' up, 'X' down, '<' left, '>' right

*Line 7.*
* Repeat keyboard input for the appropriate amount of time
*	Make move sound
*	Update location index for head

*Line 8.*
*	Update location index for tail
*	Get pixel colour at next location 

*Line 9.*
*	Print head and neck, blank out vacated tail location
*	Depending on pixel colour GOTO line 2 (yellow/blue/outside box=dead), 4 (red=target), 6 (black=empty cell)

### Variables

Although the source code is only 805 bytes - including line numbers and newline characters - it contains so many variables that I went through almost the entire alphabet. (*o* and *l* look too much like numerals, and the variable name *e* has been retired to commemorate the late [Bob Holness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A89qtdOsnw).) Even so, several of the variables are re-used to make the code shorter:

*a.* x location of target / value 18 = VDU code for GCOL   
*b.* y location of target / value 13 = y-location of status bar, thickness of line around box  
*c.* colour variable indicating pixel colour at next location: -1 = outside box, 0 = black, 1 = red, 2 = yellow, 3 = blue  
*d.* constant 32 = ASCII space / width of 1 character    
*f.* temporary flag variable  
*g.* game score  
*h.* high score  
*i.* temporary variable  
*j.* temporary variable  
*k.* constant 31 = VDU code to set cartesian coordinates  
*m.* constant 42 = maximum length of caterpillar / ASCII `*`  
*n.* number of lives left  
*p.* flag variable: 0 = this is normal food, -1 = this food is a power pill  
*q.* flag variable: 0 = normal speed, -1 = whoosh! you just ate a power pill  
*r.* real length of caterpillar  
*s.* screen length of caterpillar  
*t.* index of tail position  
*u.* index of current position of head  
*v.* index of next position of head  
*w.* wait duration of 1.2 seconds between lives / value 120 = ASCII `x`  
*x.* address of vector of x-locations / value 1028 = 10.28 seconds duration of power pill effect  
*y.* address of vector of y-locations   
*z.* constant 380 = x/y location of top left corner of box / 3.8 second delay after showing hiscore message  
*T.* most recent value of TIME (in units of 0.01 second)  
*U.* value of TIME after last move  
*X.* direction of next move: 1=left, -1=right  
*Y.* direction of next move: 1=up, -1=down 

As a side effect of storing the caterpillar segment locations in memory addresses starting at &404, the program stomps all over whatever values might have been in the integer variables *A%* through *U%*. (In an earlier version of the code, *x* took the value of &400 rather than &404. I discovered that trashing *@%* caused unpredictable changes in number formatting when printing the score.) 

### "Improvements"

Sometimes I refactor the codebase to individualise certain game parameters. The rest of you are just lousy cheats.

* *Infinite lives:* Remove `n=n-1:` at the beginning of line 2  
* *Longer caterpillar:* Change `r=5` in line 1 to `r=10` or some other value  
* *Faster game:* Change the inequality in line 7 from `T>U+40-r+10*q` to, say, `T>U+30-r+10*q`
